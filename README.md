Day 1: 5th October 2018. 
Starting from (nearly zero). completed Codecademy's Introduction to Python programme. very basic! But enough to get started. I think the most important thing is to just keep thinking, reading, watching, writing, solving problems.

Going to sign up to Dataquest track today.
